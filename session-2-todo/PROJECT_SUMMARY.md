## 🎓 Learning Path

### Phase 1: Setup (15 min)
Students learn to:
- Fork a repository
- Clone to local machine
- Create a branch
- Navigate file structure

### Phase 2: Fix Bugs (30 min)
Students practice:
- Reading error messages
- Debugging logic errors
- Testing their code
- Making small, focused commits

### Phase 3: Complete Functions (20 min)
Students implement:
- String concatenation
- Type conversion (str())
- Conditional logic
- Edge case handling

### Phase 4: Submit & Review (25 min)
Students experience:
- Pushing to GitHub
- Creating pull requests
- Automated testing
- Code review process

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Exercises

**calculator.py** (5 functions)
- 1 correct (example)
- 2 with bugs to fix
- 2 to complete from scratch
- Edge case: division by zero

**greeting.py** (5 functions)
- 2 to complete
- 1 incomplete (partial code)
- 1 with spacing bug
- 1 combining multiple elements

**student_info.py** (5 functions)
- 1 with swapped values
- 2 with incorrect logic
- 2 to complete
- Boundary testing emphasis

### Tests

**Basic Tests (tests/)**
- Test core functionality
- Provide clear error messages
- Give helpful hints
- Exit with proper codes

**Hidden Tests (hidden_tests/)**
- Test edge cases
- Test boundary conditions
- Test with unusual inputs
- Teach robustness

### GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
Triggers: Pull Request to main
Steps:
  1. Checkout code
  2. Setup Python 3.9
  3. Run basic tests (must pass)
  4. Run hidden tests (can fail)
  5. Provide feedback
```

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Why Intentional Bugs?

- More engaging than blank templates
- Teaches debugging skills
- Simulates real-world scenarios
